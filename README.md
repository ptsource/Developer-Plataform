# Computer programming

Computer programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language.

# PTSource Developer Platform
### Current version 16 released 24/03/2019 compiled and tested under Windows 10

PTSource Developer Platform is a free professional IDE, Source Code Editor and Compiler, tools, templates and  libs for professionals and students. It offers many powerful features for programming languages and syntax highlighing for over 100 languages. It already brings integrates Harbour, MingGW-w64, TCC and FASM as native compilers but supports a wide variety of compilers and assemblers.

Harbour is the open/free software implementation of a cross-platform, multi-threading, object-oriented, scriptable programming language, backwards compatible with xBase languages. Harbour consists of a compiler and runtime libraries with multiple UI, database and I/O backends, its own build system and a collection of libraries and bindings for popular APIs. With Harbour, you can build apps running on GNU/Linux, Windows (32/64-bit), macOS, iOS, Android, *BSD, *nix, and more.
