# Computer programming

Computer programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language.

# PTSource Developer Platform
### Current version 18 released 10/11/2019 compiled and tested under Windows 10

PTSource Developer Platform is a free professional IDE, Source Code Editor and Compiler, tools, templates and  libs for professionals and students. It offers many powerful features for programming languages and syntax highlighing for over 100 languages. It already brings integrates Harbour, MingGW-w64, TCC and FASM as native compilers but supports a wide variety of compilers and assemblers.

## Integrated PTSource Shell

PTSource Shell is a Unix Programming Environment compatible environment that runs natively on Microsoft Windows. Its goal is to allow programs of Unix-like systems to be recompiled and run natively on Windows with minimal source code modifications by providing them with the same underlying API they would expect in those systems.

PTSource Shell installation directory behaves like the root and follows a similar directory layout to that found in Unix-like systems, with familiar directories like /bin, /home, /etc, /usr, /var available within it, and includes by default hundreds of programs and command-line tools commonly found in the Unix world.

PTSource Shell provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from the PTSource Shell environment, as well as to use PTSource Shell tools and applications within the Windows operating context.

## Integrated PTSource PHP-HUM

PTSource PHP-HUM (Hummingbird) is a set of PHP extensions that allows PHP programmers to build native Windows applications. It wraps Windows APIS in a lightweight manner making all easy-to-use, so that program creation is simple and fun. It allows PHP programmers to easily build native Windows applications, producing quick and rewarding results with minimum effort. Even short scripts with a few dozen lines can generate a useful program, thanks to the power and flexibility of PHP.
